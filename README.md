# Minervina et al. mild COVID-19 longitudinal TCRseq dataset
This repostitory contains procesed TCRalpha and TCRbeta repertoire datasets (and some results as well) for the paper by Minervina et al. on mild COVID-19 (link to arxiv/biorxiv coming soon!).

## Putatively COVID-19 reactive TCRbeta and TCRalpha sequences
Two groups of TCR clones were identified for both donors: 

_contracting_ clones are clones contracting in the repertoire from day 15 to day 45 post-infection. 

_expanding_ clones go up from day 15 to day 37 post-infection. 

Both groups were identified with edgeR (FDR-adjusted p<0.01, log2FC threshold=2). Clone counts are given as in first replicate of PBMC on day 15 (for _contracting_) and day 37 (for _expanding_ group).

## Full dataset
The complete data is available on zenodo in mixcr format: (link coming soon!)

## Raw data
The raw sequencing data is available at Short Read Archive acc. PRJNA633317.

## Raw data preprocessing instructions
